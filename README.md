# vBSSO

Provides universal Secure Single Sign-On between vBulletin and different popular platforms like WordPress.

### Description

Provides universal Single Sign-On feature so that WordPress can use the vBulletin user database to manage authentication
and user profile data. 

The system has two components. First, thereâ€™s a vBulletin plugin that creates an interface for authenticating, controlling access, and managing user profile data. The second component is plugins for other platforms (like WordPress) that teach it to talk to vBulletin and exchange data.

Support is available at https://www.vbsso.com only.

This plugin is provided as is. Support and additional customizations are available at an hourly rate.

Plugin doesn't share any user related information with any third party side. It strongly synchronizes the information
between your own platforms connected personally to your vBulletin instance.

Plugin doesn't revert already sync data back to its original state if you decide to disable plugin later.
